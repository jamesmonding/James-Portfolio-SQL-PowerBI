# Real Estate SQL Database & Power BI Project

This project showcases my SQL skills, database design knowledge, and real estate analytics background.

It includes:
- Normalized SQL database (1NF–3NF)
- ERD/EER diagrams
- Sample property dataset
- SQL analytical queries (cap rate, rental yield, valuation trends)
- Documentation and data model

This will also connect to my Power BI real estate analytics dashboard.
